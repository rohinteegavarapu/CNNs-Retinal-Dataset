This folder must be put in the file path "C:\" (SSD) or "D:\" (External Hard Drive) for the referenced directories in the program to function properly.

This repository contains:

Full Training Dataset (REQUIRED):

Normal: 26,315 Images

CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization): 37,205 Images

DME (Diabetic Macular Edema): 11,348 Images

Drusen: 8,616 Images

Total: 83,484 Images

Testing Dataset (REQUIRED):

Normal: 250 Images

CNV: 250 Images

DME: 250 Images

Drusen: 250 Images


Training Dataset Portions of:

5000 Images Per Class (20,000 Images Total)

1000 Images Per Class (4,000 Images Total)

250 Images Per Class (1,000 Images Total)

A proper run of the program with the full dataset should last around 45 - 75 minutes, depending on your device.
